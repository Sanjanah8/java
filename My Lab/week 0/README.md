##**1.Write a Java program to calculate the monthly salary of an employee based on the following criteria:**

Define an array to store employee names (at least 5 names).
Ask the user to input the basic salary of the employee.
Calculate the House Rent Allowance (HRA) as 10% of the basic salary.
Calculate the Dearness Allowance (DA) as 8% of the basic salary.
Calculate the Gross Salary as the sum of basic salary, HRA, and DA.
Deduct the Provident Fund (PF) from the Gross Salary, which is 5% of the basic salary.
Display the Net Salary after deducting the PF.


##**2.Write a Java program to simulate a student grading system using arrays:**

Define an array to store student names (at least 5 names).
Define an array to store grades for each student (at least 5 subjects per student).
Calculate and print the total and average mark for each student.
Calculate and print the grade based on average mark for each student(A:80-100,B:60-80,C-40-60,F:<40).
Display a menu for the user to perform any of the above operations.
Ensure the program handles input validation and displays appropriate messages for the user.


##**3.Write a Java program to calculate the total bill amount for a customer based on the following menu:**

Ask the user to input the number of items purchased.
For each item, ask the user to input the item name, quantity purchased, and price per unit.
Calculate the total cost for each item (quantity * price per unit).
Calculate the subtotal of all items.
Apply a discount based on the total amount:
If the subtotal is greater than or equal to 4000, apply a 10% discount.
If the subtotal is between 2000 and 3999, apply a 5% discount.
If the subtotal is less than 2000, no discount is applied.
Calculate the final bill amount after applying the discount.
Display the item details (name, quantity, price per unit, total cost), subtotal, discount amount (if any), and final bill amount.
                                                                                              

##**4.Write a Java program to calculate the electricity bill for a customer based on the following criteria:**

Ask the user to input the consumer number, name, and units consumed.
Calculate the bill amount based on the following rates:
For the first 100 units: Rs. 1.50 per unit
For the next 200 units (101 to 300): Rs. 2.00 per unit
For any units above 300: Rs. 3.00 per unit
Add a fixed meter charge of Rs. 50 to the total bill amount.
Apply a surcharge of 2% on the total bill amount if the total bill exceeds Rs. 5000.
Display the consumer details (consumer number and name), units consumed, bill amount before and after surcharge, and total amount payable.
Ensure the program handles input validation and displays appropriate messages for the user.
