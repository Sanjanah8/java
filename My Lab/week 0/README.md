## **Task 2: Real-World Java Programs**

1. **Write a Java program to calculate the monthly salary of an employee based on the following criteria:**

   - Define an array to store employee names (at least 5 names).
   - Ask the user to input the basic salary of the employee.
   - Calculate the House Rent Allowance (HRA) as 10% of the basic salary.
   - Calculate the Dearness Allowance (DA) as 8% of the basic salary.
   - Calculate the Gross Salary as the sum of basic salary, HRA, and DA.
   - Deduct the Provident Fund (PF) from the Gross Salary, which is 5% of the basic salary.
   - Display the Net Salary after deducting the PF.

2. **Write a Java program to simulate a student grading system using arrays:**

   - Define an array to store student names (at least 5 names).
   - Define an array to store grades for each student (at least 5 subjects per student).
   - Calculate and print the total and average mark for each student.
   - Calculate and print the grade based on average mark for each student (A: 80-100, B: 60-80, C: 40-60, F: <40).
   - Display a menu for the user to perform any of the above operations.
   - Ensure the program handles input validation and displays appropriate messages for the user.

3. **Write a Java program to calculate the total bill amount for a customer based on the following menu:**

   - Ask the user to input the number of items purchased.
   - For each item, ask the user to input the item name, quantity purchased, and price per unit.
   - Calculate the total cost for each item (quantity * price per unit).
   - Calculate the subtotal of all items.
   - Apply a discount based on the total amount:
     - If the subtotal is greater than or equal to 4000, apply a 10% discount.
     - If the subtotal is between 2000 and 3999, apply a 5% discount.
     - If the subtotal is less than 2000, no discount is applied.
   - Calculate the final bill amount after applying the discount.
   - Display the item details (name, quantity, price per unit, total cost), subtotal, discount amount (if any), and final bill amount.

4. **Write a Java program to calculate the electricity bill for a customer based on the following criteria:**

   - Ask the user to input the consumer number, name, and units consumed.
   - Calculate the bill amount based on the following rates:
     - For the first 100 units: Rs. 1.50 per unit
     - For the next 200 units (101 to 300): Rs. 2.00 per unit
     - For any units above 300: Rs. 3.00 per unit
   - Add a fixed meter charge of Rs. 50 to the total bill amount.
   - Apply a surcharge of 2% on the total bill amount if the total bill exceeds Rs. 5000.
   - Display the consumer details (consumer number and name), units consumed, bill amount before and after surcharge, and total amount payable.
   - Ensure the program handles input validation and displays appropriate messages for the user.
