# Overview of Java
Here's a detailed technical overview of Java, covering key concepts such as interfaces, streams, and more, along with essential points to remember for interviews and quick reference.
## Core Concepts

### 1. **Java Basics**
- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**: Executes Java bytecode and provides platform independence.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Includes tools for Java development, such as the compiler (`javac`), debugger, and JVM.
- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: Provides the JVM and standard libraries for running Java applications.
### Important Points About Java

#### **Compiled and Interpreted Language**
- **Compiled**: Java code is first compiled into bytecode (`.class` files) by the Java Compiler (`javac`). This bytecode is platform-independent.
- **Interpreted**: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) interprets and executes the bytecode on any platform. This allows Java to be platform-independent, following the "write once, run anywhere" principle.

#### **2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit, known as a class, and restricting access to some of the object's components.
- **Inheritance**: Java supports single inheritance, where a class can inherit from only one superclass. Multiple inheritance (inheriting from multiple classes) is not supported directly but can be achieved through interfaces.
- **Polymorphism**: Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. Method overriding and overloading are examples.
- **Abstraction**: The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

#### **3. Class and Object**
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. Defines a datatype by bundling data and methods.
- **Object**: An instance of a class, representing a specific implementation of the class with concrete values.

#### **4. Interfaces and Abstract Classes**
- **Interfaces**: Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces. A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to inherit abstract methods from multiple sources.
- **Abstract Classes**: Cannot be instantiated and can contain abstract methods (methods without implementation) as well as concrete methods (methods with implementation). Used to provide a common base for subclasses.

#### **5. Memory Management**
- **Garbage Collection**: Java has automatic garbage collection to manage memory, which reclaims memory used by objects that are no longer referenced by the program.

#### **6. Exception Handling**
- **Exception Handling**: Java provides a robust mechanism for handling exceptions using `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, and `throws` keywords. This helps in managing errors gracefully and maintaining program flow.
- - **Try-Catch-Finally**: Handles exceptions and ensures resources are released.
  - **Try Block**: Contains code that might throw an exception.
  - **Catch Block**: Handles specific exceptions.
  - **Finally Block**: Executes code regardless of whether an exception occurred.
- **Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions**:
  - **Checked Exceptions**: Must be handled or declared (`IOException`, `SQLException`).
  - **Unchecked Exceptions**: Runtime exceptions that do not need to be declared or handled (`NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`).

#### **7. Concurrency**
- **Multithreading**: Java supports multithreading, allowing multiple threads to run concurrently. The `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface are used to create and manage threads.
- **Synchronization**: Java provides synchronization mechanisms to prevent concurrent access issues, using `synchronized` blocks or methods.
- - **Threads**: Java supports multithreading using `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface.
- **Synchronization**: Ensures thread safety by synchronizing access to shared resources.
- **Concurrency Utilities**: Java provides utilities like `ExecutorService`, `Future`, `CountDownLatch`, and `Semaphore` for managing concurrency.


#### **8. Platform Independence**
- **Java Bytecode**: Java programs are compiled into platform-independent bytecode, which is executed by the JVM on any platform, ensuring portability.

#### **9. Standard Libraries and APIs**
- **Java Standard Library**: Includes a wide range of built-in libraries and APIs for tasks like data manipulation, networking, file handling, and GUI development (e.g., `java.util`, `java.io`, `java.net`, `javax.swing`).

#### **10. Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**
- **JVM**: Executes Java bytecode and provides an environment for Java programs to run. It handles memory management, garbage collection, and security.

#### **11. Java Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**
- **JDK**: A development kit that includes the JRE along with tools for developing Java applications, such as the compiler (`javac`), debugger (`jdb`), and other development tools.
- **JRE**: Provides the runtime environment needed to run Java applications, including the JVM and standard libraries.

#### **12. Java Keywords and Modifiers**
- **Access Modifiers**: `public`, `protected`, and `private` control access to classes, methods, and variables.
- **Other Modifiers**: `static`, `final`, `abstract`, `synchronized`, `volatile`, `transient`, etc., each providing specific functionalities and constraints.

### **Java Collections Framework**
- **Interfaces**: `List`, `Set`, `Map` – Provide abstract data structures.
- **Implementations**: `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap` – Concrete classes implementing these interfaces.
- **Common Methods**: `add()`, `remove()`, `contains()`, `size()`, `clear()`, `iterator()`.

### **Streams API**
- **Definition**: The Streams API allows functional-style operations on sequences of elements, such as collections and arrays.
- **Key Operations**:
  - **Intermediate Operations**: `filter()`, `map()`, `sorted()`, `distinct()`.
  - **Terminal Operations**: `collect()`, `forEach()`, `reduce()`, `count()`.
- **Syntax**: `Collection.stream().filter(...).map(...).collect(Collectors.toList())`.

### **Java Memory Management**
- **Heap vs Stack**:
  - **Heap**: Stores objects and their references.
  - **Stack**: Stores method calls and local variables.
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatically reclaims memory used by objects that are no longer reachable.

### **Design Patterns**
- **Common Patterns**:
  - **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.
  - **Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class of object to be created.
  - **Observer**: Allows objects to notify other objects about changes in their state.
 ### Key Points About Tomcat and Servlets

#### Apache Tomcat
- **Definition**: Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet container that implements Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and Java Expression Language (EL) specifications.
- **Purpose**: It is used to run Java web applications by providing a runtime environment for servlets and JSPs.
- **Features**:
  - **Servlet Container**: Manages the lifecycle of servlets, processes requests, and sends responses.
  - **JSP Engine**: Translates JSPs into servlets and compiles them.
  - **Web Management Interface**: Provides a web-based interface for managing and monitoring Tomcat.
  - **Support for Java EE**: Supports Java EE specifications like Servlet API and JSP API.
  - **Configuration**: Configuration files include `server.xml`, `web.xml`, and `context.xml` which control server settings, application deployment, and context configurations.

#### Java Servlets
- **Definition**: Java Servlets are server-side programs written in Java that handle client requests and generate dynamic web content, typically used to extend the capabilities of web servers.
- **Lifecycle**:
  - **Initialization**: The servlet is loaded into memory and initialized using the `init()` method.
  - **Request Handling**: The servlet handles requests through the `service()` method, where it processes client requests and generates responses.
  - **Destruction**: When the servlet is no longer needed, it is destroyed using the `destroy()` method.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `init()`: Initializes the servlet. Called once when the servlet is loaded.
  - `service(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)`: Processes requests and generates responses.
  - `destroy()`: Cleans up resources before the servlet is destroyed.
- **Common Use Cases**:
  - **Handling Form Submissions**: Processing form data submitted by users.
  - **Session Management**: Tracking user sessions and maintaining user state.
  - **Database Interaction**: Connecting to databases and performing CRUD operations.
- **Deployment Descriptor**: The `web.xml` file in the `WEB-INF` directory defines servlet configurations, mappings, and initialization parameters.
